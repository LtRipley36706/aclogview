[Slushnas]
##### Interface Changes

    You can right-click on an item in this new listview and jump to that message in the main packet listview. 
    There is also a new context menu option in the parsed data treeview that allows you to search for a selected object ID in the objects listview.
* Added double buffering to main form list views to prevent flickering.

### 2017-12-09
[Slushnas]

* Added double buffering to treeview class by using a custom override. This should prevent most flicker in the treeview when updating.

* Refactored treeview node expansion state and TopNode code.
* Renamed the utility function Utility.FormatGuid to Utility.FormatHex and **_Display Guid as Hex_** to **_Display Data as Hex_** since it is used for more fields than just Guids. (Example: bitmasks)

will now load faster in some cases.
